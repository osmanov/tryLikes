# tryLikes
I didn't try to make everything,just the main things for understanding.
No parallax,no bottom stuff for the first page,no svg component with thumbs.
### Ok,how I can interact?
* If user clicks by like thumb --> user will see `layout banner with people`
* If user clicks by dislike button --> user redirect to `/dislike`

Details:
- [x] webpack+react+redux settings
- [x] custom redux boilerplate 
- [x] css for responsiveness (`header` and `layout banner with people`)
- [x] don't use any css framework 

### Summary:
clear time for today: 11h 31min
